# Digit-Recognizer-AI

This repository contains two machine learning models designed to recognize handwritten digits. These models are implemented using TensorFlow and Keras and trained on the MNIST Kaggle training dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer ), which consists of 20,000+ images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## Models

1. **CNN Model**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that achieves high accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits by capturing spatial hierarchies in the images, passing it through a fully connected network
2. **MLP Model**: A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model that uses 3 densely connected layers to classify digits based on directly learning the pixel values.

## Prerequisites

Before running the models, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.6+
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)
